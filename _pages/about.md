Biography
------
Hi! I'm Rui-Jie (Ridger), currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, where I began in Fall 2023 under the supervision of [Jason K. Eshraghian](https://ncg.ucsc.edu/jason-eshraghian-bio/). I earned my Bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in the same year.

My deep learning journey started with spiking neural networks. During my undergraduate studies, I contributed to several open-source neuromorphic projects, including [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch) and [SpikingJelly](https://github.com/fangwei123456/spikingjelly). As my interests expanded, I shifted focus to efficient language models. I joined the development of [RWKV](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM), the first RNN-based language model, and developed [SpikeGPT](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gcf1anBL9e) and [Matmul-free LM](https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm). Currently, my research focuses on scaling up models through the lens of efficient inference.
