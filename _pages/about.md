Biography
------
Hi! This is Rui-Jie (Ridger). I am currently a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, having started in the Fall of 2023, with Jason Eshraghian as my supervisor. I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China not long ago. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was deeply involved in several open-source neuromorphic projects, including notable ones like [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch) and [SpikingJelly](https://github.com/fangwei123456/spikingjelly). I am proud to have led the development of [SpikeGPT](https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT), a pioneering spiking neural network generative language model. My interests extend beyond neuromorphic projects; I am deeply fascinated by large language models and had the privilege to be one of the authors of the [RWKV](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) large language model. In 2020, I took on the role of Chair for the Students Open-Source Conference ([sosconf](https://sosconf.org)), a significant event that saw participation from over 3,000 attendees online. My main research interest lies in pushing the boundaries of large-scale spiking neural networks. Beyond the world of academia, I have a passion for filmmaking and hiking.
