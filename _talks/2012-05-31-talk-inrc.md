The talk dive into SpikeGPT, the pioneering large-scale language model using spiking neural networks (SNNs). With the rising demand for lightweight language models due to security and energy consumption concerns, SpikeGPT offers a solution that decomposes self-attention into a format suitable for spiking neurons. The talk will also offer a hands-on demo, showing attendees how to experiment with pre-trained SpikeGPT models available on HuggingFace.
